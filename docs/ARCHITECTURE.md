## Components:
1. **IoT Sensors & Devices** - Collect real-time worker data.
2. **Edge Processing (Raspberry Pi)** - Process data before sending to the cloud.
3. **Cloud Server (Firebase/Backend)** - Stores and manages data.
4. **Dashboard (React.js)** - Displays worker health and safety insights.
5. **Notification System** - Alerts supervisors of critical conditions.
